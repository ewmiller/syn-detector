# SYN Detector

A python program that scans .pcap files and reports IP addresses that sent an abnormally high amount of SYN requests, in order to detect SYN scanning.

Usage: `python detector.py file.pcap`

The full pcap file for this project is too large to include on git, but it can be downloaded here: ftp://ftp.bro-ids.org/enterprise-traces/hdr-traces05/lbl-internal.20041004-1305.port002.dump.anon
